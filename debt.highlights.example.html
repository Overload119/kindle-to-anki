Despite this , from the beginning , the Malagasy people were told they owed France money , and to this day , the Malagasy people are still held to owe France money , and the rest of the world accepts the justice of this arrangement .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 6 &middot; Location 217</div><div class='noteText'>France immediately insisted that the new republic owed it 150 million francs in damages for the expropriated plantations , as well as the expenses of outfitting the failed military expeditions , and all other nations , including the United States , agreed to impose an embargo on the country until it was paid . The sum was intentionally impossible ( equivalent to about 18 billion dollars ) , and the resultant embargo ensured that the name “ Haiti ” has been a synonym for debt , poverty , and human misery ever since .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 9 &middot; Location 287</div><div class='noteText'>Often , when a poor man had to borrow money for his daughter’s marriage , the security would be the bride herself . She would be expected to report to the lender’s household after her wedding night , spend a few months there as his concubine , and then , once he grew bored , be sent off to some nearby timber camp , where she would have to spend the next year or two working as a prostitute to pay off her father’s debt . Once accounts were settled , she return to her husband and begin her married life .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 13 &middot; Location 358</div><div class='noteText'>On the other hand , when we say someone acts like they “ don’t owe anything to anybody , ” we’re hardly describing that person as a paragon of virtue .</div>

<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 13 &middot; Location 369</div><div class='noteText'>What , precisely , does it mean to say that our sense of morality and justice is reduced to the language of a business deal ?</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 14 &middot; Location 380</div><div class='noteText'>is money’s capacity to turn morality into a matter of impersonal arithmetic — and by doing so , to justify things that would otherwise seem outrageous or obscene .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 14 &middot; Location 382</div><div class='noteText'>The difference between a “ debt ” and a mere moral obligation is not the presence or absence of men with weapons who can enforce that obligation by seizing the debtor’s possessions or threatening to break his legs . It is simply that a creditor has the means to specify , numerically , exactly how much the debtor owes .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 14 &middot; Location 393</div><div class='noteText'>state and market , our most basic conceptions of the nature of freedom , morality , sociality — all of which have been shaped by a history of war , conquest , and slavery in ways we’re no longer capable of even perceiving because we can no longer imagine things any other way .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 15 &middot; Location 407</div><div class='noteText'>The message was transparent : leave these things to the professionals . You couldn’t possibly get your minds around this . Even if you don’t like financial capitalists very much ( and few seemed inclined to argue that there was much to like about them ) , they were nothing if not capable , in fact so preternaturally capable that democratic oversight of financial markets was simply inconceivable .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 16 &middot; Location 432</div><div class='noteText'>In colonial days , an insolvent debtor’s ear was often nailed to a post .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 16 &middot; Location 433</div><div class='noteText'>The United States was one of the last countries in the world to adopt a law of bankruptcy : despite the fact that in 1787 , the Constitution specifically charged the new government with creating one , all attempts were rejected , or quickly reversed , on “ moral grounds ” until 1898.13</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 17 &middot; Location 441</div><div class='noteText'>“ It’s not a crime to owe money , ” reports the Minneapolis - St . Paul StarTribune , “ But people are routinely being thrown in jail for failing to pay debts . ” In Minnesota , “ the use of arrest warrants against debtors has jumped 60 percent over the past four years , with 845 cases in 2009 … In Illinois and southwest Indiana , some judges jail debtors for missing court - ordered debt payments . In extreme cases , people stay in jail until they raise a minimum payment . In January [ 2010 ] , a judge sentenced a Kenney , Ill . , man ‘ to indefinite incarceration ’ until he came up with $ 300 toward a lumber yard debt . ”</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 500</div><div class='noteText'>The difference between a debt and an obligation is that a debt can be precisely quantified . This requires money .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 21 &middot; Location 502</div><div class='noteText'>Some of the very first written documents that have come down to us are Mesopotamian tablets recording credits and debits , rations issued by temples , money owed for rent of temple lands , the value of each precisely specified in grain and silver . Some of the earliest works of moral philosophy , in turn , are reflections on what it means to imagine morality as debt — that is , in terms of money .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 22 &middot; Location 515</div><div class='noteText'>since it’s almost impossible to pretend that those lending and borrowing money are acting on purely “ economic ” motivations ( for instance , that a loan to a stranger is the same as a loan to one’s cousin ) ; it seems important , therefore , to begin the story of money in an imaginary world from which credit and debt have been entirely erased .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 23 &middot; Location 544</div><div class='noteText'>Well , let us imagine an economy something like today’s , except with no money . That would have been decidedly inconvenient ! Surely , people must have invented money for the sake of efficiency .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 24 &middot; Location 562</div><div class='noteText'>Money , Aristotle assumed , must have emerged from such a process . But , like the medieval schoolmen who occasionally repeated the story , Aristotle was never clear as to how .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 25 &middot; Location 573</div><div class='noteText'>It was only by making such an argument that he could insist that economics is itself a field of human inquiry with its own principles and laws — that is , as distinct from , say ethics or politics .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 25 &middot; Location 579</div><div class='noteText'>But humans , if left to their own devices , will inevitably begin swapping and comparing things . This is just what humans do . Even logic and conversation are really just forms of trading , and as in all things , humans will always try to seek their own best advantage , to seek the greatest profit they can from the exchange . 9</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 25 &middot; Location 593</div><div class='noteText'>Notice how , as in so many examples , we have a tendency to slip from imaginary savages to small - town shopkeepers .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 26 &middot; Location 604</div><div class='noteText'>So everyone will inevitably start stockpiling something they figure that everyone else is likely to want . This has a paradoxical effect , because at a certain point , rather than making that commodity less valuable ( since everyone already has some ) it becomes more valuable ( because it becomes , effectively , currency ) :</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 27 &middot; Location 622</div><div class='noteText'>It’s easy to see where this is going . Using irregular metal ingots is easier than barter , but wouldn’t standardizing the units — say , stamping pieces of metal with uniform designations guaranteeing weight and fineness , in different denominations — make things easier still ?</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 27 &middot; Location 624</div><div class='noteText'>True , issuing coinage meant governments had to get involved , since they generally ran the mints ; but in the standard version of the story , governments have only this one limited role — to guarantee the money supply — and tend to do it badly , since throughout history , unscrupulous kings have often cheated by debasing the coinage and causing inflation and other sorts of political havoc in what was originally a matter of simple economic common sense .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 27 &middot; Location 628</div><div class='noteText'>in founding the discipline of economics , but in the very idea that there was something called “ the economy , ” which operated by its own rules , separate from moral or political life , that economists could take as their field of study .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 648</div><div class='noteText'>It is so deeply established in common sense , even in places like Madagascar , that most people on earth couldn’t imagine any other way that money possibly could have come about .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 28 &middot; Location 649</div><div class='noteText'>The problem is there’s no evidence that it ever happened , and an enormous amount of evidence suggesting that it did not .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 29 &middot; Location 654</div><div class='noteText'>the main economic institution among the Iroquois nations were longhouses where most goods were stockpiled and then allocated by women’s councils , and no one ever traded arrowheads for slabs of meat .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 29 &middot; Location 662</div><div class='noteText'>The definitive anthropological work on barter , by Caroline Humphrey , of Cambridge , could not be more definitive in its conclusions : “ No example of a barter economy , pure and simple , has ever been described , let alone the emergence from it of money ; all available ethnography suggests that there never has been such a thing . ”</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 868</div><div class='noteText'>It’s easy to see that “ money ” in this sense is in no way the product of commercial transactions . It was actually created by bureaucrats in order to keep track of resources and move things back and forth between departments .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 39 &middot; Location 882</div><div class='noteText'>Merchants ( who sometimes worked for the Temples , sometimes operated independently ) were among the few people who did , often , use silver in transactions ; but even they mostly did much of their dealings on credit , and ordinary people buying beer from “ ale women , ” or local innkeepers , once again , did so by running up a tab , to be settled at harvest time in barley or anything they might have had at hand .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 40 &middot; Location 898</div><div class='noteText'>We did not begin with barter , discover money , and then eventually develop credit systems . It happened precisely the other way around .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 45 &middot; Location 949</div><div class='noteText'>They just abandon the use of cash . In the Middle Ages , for instance , everyone continued to assess the value of tools and livestock in the old Roman currency , even if the coins themselves had ceased to circulate .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 46 &middot; Location 970</div><div class='noteText'>Theorists insisted that money is not a commodity but an accounting tool . In other words , it is not a “ thing ” at all . For a Credit Theorist can no more touch a dollar or a deutschmark than you can touch an hour or a cubic centimeter .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 46 &middot; Location 975</div><div class='noteText'>If money is a just a yardstick , what then does it measure ? The answer was simple : debt . A coin is , effectively , an IOU . Whereas conventional wisdom holds that a banknote is , or should be , a promise to pay a certain amount of “ real money ” ( gold , silver , whatever that might be taken to mean ) , Credit Theorists argued that a banknote is simply the promise to pay something of the same value as an ounce of gold .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 47 &middot; Location 990</div><div class='noteText'>The anthropologist Keith Hart once told me a story about his brother , who in the ’ 50s was a British soldier stationed in Hong Kong . Soldiers used to pay their bar tabs by writing checks on accounts back in England . Local merchants would often simply endorse them over to each other and pass them around as currency : once , he saw one of his own checks , written six months before , on the counter of a local vendor covered with about forty different tiny inscriptions in Chinese .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 49 &middot; Location 1050</div><div class='noteText'>Let us take a hypothetical example . Say a king wishes to support a standing army of fifty thousand men . Under ancient or medieval conditions , feeding such a force was an enormous problem . Such a force would likely consume anything edible within ten miles of their camp in as many days ; unless they were on the march , one would need to employ almost as many men and animals just to locate , acquire , and transport the necessary provisions . 18 On the other hand , if one simply hands out coins to the soldiers and then demands that every family in the kingdom was obliged to pay one of those coins back to you , one would , in one blow , turn one’s entire national economy into a vast machine for the provisioning of soldiers , since now every family , in order to get their hands on the coins , must find some way to contribute to the general effort to provide soldiers with things they want . Markets are brought into existence as a side effect .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 50 &middot; Location 1071</div><div class='noteText'>Not only was this tax quite high , it was also only payable in newly issued Malagasy francs . In other words , Gallieni did indeed print money and then demand that everyone in the country give some of that money back to him .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 51 &middot; Location 1075</div><div class='noteText'>Since the “ educational tax ” came due shortly after harvest time , the easiest way for farmers to pay it was to sell a portion of their rice crop to the Chinese or Indian merchants who soon installed themselves in small towns across the country .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 52 &middot; Location 1111</div><div class='noteText'>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , which appeared in 1900 , is often held to be a parable for the Populist campaign of William Jennings Bryan , who twice ran for president on the Free Silver platform — vowing to replace the gold standard with a bimetallic system that would allow the free creation of silver money alongside gold .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 53 &middot; Location 1134</div><div class='noteText'>Richard Nixon’s decision in 1971 to unpeg the dollar from precious metals entirely , eliminate the international gold standard , and introduce the system of floating currency regimes that has dominated the world economy ever since .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 53 &middot; Location 1136</div><div class='noteText'>This meant in effect that all national currencies were henceforth , as neoclassical economists like to put it , “ fiat money ” backed only by the public trust .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 55 &middot; Location 1162</div><div class='noteText'>It is one thing to explain why early states demanded taxes ( in order to create markets ) .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 56 &middot; Location 1182</div><div class='noteText'>The core argument is that any attempt to separate monetary policy from social policy is ultimately wrong . Primordial - debt theorists insist that these have always been the same thing . Governments use taxes to create money , and they are able to do so because they have become the guardians of the debt that all citizens have to one another . This debt is the essence of society itself . It exists long before money and markets , and money and markets themselves are simply ways of chopping pieces of it up .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 56 &middot; Location 1200</div><div class='noteText'>A man , being born , is a debt ; by his own self he is born to Death , and only when he sacrifices does he redeem himself from Death .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 57 &middot; Location 1206</div><div class='noteText'>In this way , the “ tribute ” of sacrifice could be seen as a kind of interest payment , with the life of the animal substituting temporarily for what’s really owed , which is ourselves — a mere postponement of the inevitable .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 1247</div><div class='noteText'>In all Indo - European languages , words for “ debt ” are synonymous with those for “ sin ” or “ guilt , ” illustrating the links between religion , payment and the mediation of the sacred and profane realms by “ money . ” For example , there is a connection between money ( German Geld ) , indemnity or sacrifice ( Old English Geild ) , tax ( Gothic Gild ) and , of course , guilt . 41</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 1252</div><div class='noteText'>that in Homer , when people measure the value of a ship or suit of armor , they always measure it in oxen — even though when they actually exchange things , they never pay for anything in oxen .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 1256</div><div class='noteText'>If the king has simply taken over guardianship of that primordial debt we all owe to society for having created us , this provides a very neat explanation for why the government feels it has the right to make us pay taxes .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 59 &middot; Location 1258</div><div class='noteText'>Taxes are just a measure of our debt to the society that made us .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 60 &middot; Location 1278</div><div class='noteText'>There is every reason to believe that our own money started the same way — even the English word “ to pay ” is originally derived from a word for “ to pacify , appease ” — as in , to give someone something precious , for instance , to express just how badly you feel about having just killed his brother in a drunken brawl , and how much you would really like to avoid this becoming the basis for an ongoing blood - feud .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 63 &middot; Location 1341</div><div class='noteText'>“ Classical Greeks looked upon direct taxes as tyrannical and avoided them whenever possible . ” 51 Athenian citizens did not pay direct taxes of any sort , though the city did sometimes distribute money to its citizens , a kind of reverse taxation — either directly , as with the proceeds of the Laurium silver mines , and indirectly , through generous fees for jury duty or attending the assembly .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 63 &middot; Location 1344</div><div class='noteText'>Subject cities , however , did have to pay tribute . Even within the Persian Empire , Persians did not have to pay tribute to the Great King , but the inhabitants of conquered provinces did .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 68 &middot; Location 1441</div><div class='noteText'>All the more so if one is speaking of the universe . If you cannot bargain with the gods because they already have everything , then you certainly cannot bargain with the universe , because the universe is everything — and that everything necessarily includes yourself . One could in fact interpret this list as a subtle way of saying that the only way of “ freeing oneself ” from the debt was not literally repaying debts , but rather showing that these debts do not exist because one is not in fact separate to begin with , and hence that the very notion of canceling the debt and achieving a separate , autonomous existence was ridiculous from the start .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 70 &middot; Location 1484</div><div class='noteText'>We have already accumulated endless debts before we get to the age at which we can even think of paying them . By that time , there’s no way to calculate to whom we even owe them . The only way to redeem ourselves is to dedicate ourselves to the service of Humanity as a whole .</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 72 &middot; Location 1509</div><div class='noteText'>We are constantly told that they are opposites and that between them they contain the only real human possibilities .

<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 1614</div><div class='noteText'>As communities grow into kingdoms and kingdoms into universal empires , the gods themselves come to seem more universal , they take on grander , more cosmic pretentions , ruling the heavens , casting thunderbolts — culminating in the Christian god , who , as the maximal deity , necessarily “ brought about the maximum feeling of indebtedness on earth . ”</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 78 &middot; Location 1626</div><div class='noteText'>What Nietzsche is doing here is starting out from the standard , common - sense assumptions about the nature of human beings prevalent in his day ( and to a large extent , still prevalent ) — that we are rational calculating machines , that commercial self - interest comes before society , that “ society ” itself is just a way of putting a kind of temporary lid on the resulting conflict . That is , he is starting out from ordinary bourgeois assumptions and driving them to a place where they can only shock a bourgeois audience .</div>

<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 79 &middot; Location 1641</div><div class='noteText'>Rather than seeing himself as human because he could make economic calculations , the hunter insisted that being truly human meant refusing to make such calculations , refusing to measure or remember who had given what to whom , for the precise reason that doing so would inevitably create a world where we began “ comparing power with power , measuring , calculating ”</div>
<div class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Page 80 &middot; Location 1652</div><div class='noteText'>Niezsche’s account of “ primeval times ” might be absurd , but his description of Christianity — of how a sense of debt is transformed into an abiding sense of guilt , and guilt to self - loathing , and self - loathing to self - torture — all of this does ring very true .</div>
