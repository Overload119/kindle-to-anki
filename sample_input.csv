"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 2","","They are those whose desires and struggles are out of proportion to their actions and achievements."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 4","","If I am to listen to another man's opinion, it must be expressed positively. Of things problematical I have enough in myself."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 5","","fulfil a duty is still always to feel it as a debt, for it is never quite satisfying to oneself."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 9","","When I err, every one can see it; but not when I lie."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 9","","'The finest hair throws a shadow.'"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 10","","If a man thinks about his physical or moral condition, he generally finds that he is ill."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 11","","The man who is up and doing should see to it that what he does is right. Whether or not right is done, is a matter which should not trouble him."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 14","","rainbow which lasts a quarter of an hour is looked at no more."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 15","","The really foolish thing in men who are otherwise intelligent is that they fail to understand what another person says, when he does not exactly hit upon the right way of saying it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 16","","By force of habit we look at a clock that has run down as if it were still going, and we gaze at the face of a beauty as though she still loved."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 16","","Hatred is active displeasure, envy passive."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 23","","Raw matter is seen by every one; the contents are found only by him who has his eyes about him; and the form is a secret to the majority."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 27","","A great work limits us for the moment, because we feel it above our powers; and only in so far as we afterwards incorporate it with our culture, and make it part of our mind and heart, does it become a dear and worthy object."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 28","","Absurdities presented with good taste rouse disgust and admiration."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 30","","In the matter of knowledge, it has happened to me as to one who rises early, and in the dark impatiently awaits the dawn, and then the sun; but is blinded when it appears."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 37","","There is no greater consolation for mediocrity than that the genius is not immortal."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 37","","Difficulties increase the nearer we come to our aim."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 42","","From a strict point of view we must have a reformation of ourselves every day, and protest against others, even though it be in no religious sense."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 42","","It should be our earnest endeavour to use words coinciding as closely as possible with what we feel, see, think, experience, imagine, and reason. It is an endeavour which we cannot evade, and which is daily to be renewed. Let every man examine himself, and he will find this a much harder task than he might suppose; for, unhappily, a man usually takes words as mere make-shifts; his knowledge and his thought are in most cases better than his method of expression. False, irrelevant, and futile ideas may arise in ourselves and others, or find their way into us from without. Let us persist in the effort to remove them as far as we can, by plain and honest purpose."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 43","","It is not the intelligent man who rules, but intelligence; not the wise man, but wisdom."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 46","","The lower animal is taught by its organs; man teaches his organs, and dominates them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 46","","Kepler said: 'My wish is that I may perceive the God whom I find everywhere in the external world, in like manner also within and inside me.' The good man was not aware that in that very moment the divine in him stood in the closest connection with the divine in the Universe."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 47","","Faith, Love, and Hope once felt, in a quiet sociable hour, a plastic impulse in their nature; they worked together and created a lovely image, a Pandora in the higher sense, Patience."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 47","","If you miss the first button-hole, you will not succeed in buttoning up your coat."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 50","","The truest liberality is appreciation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 50","","Some men think about the defects of their friends, and there is nothing to be gained by it. I have always paid attention to the merits of my enemies, and found it an advantage."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 51","","We have long been busy with the critique of reason. I should like to see a critique of common-sense. It would be a real benefit to mankind if we could convincingly prove to the ordinary intelligence how far it can go; and that is just as much as it fully requires for life on this earth."

"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 69","","When a man sees a phenomenon before him, his thoughts often range beyond it; when he hears it only talked about, he has no thoughts at all."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 74","","Everything that comes into being seeks room for itself and desires duration: hence it drives something else from its place and shortens its duration."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 74","","What a true saying it is that he who wants to deceive mankind must before all things make absurdity plausible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 75","","There are two things of which a man cannot be careful enough: of obstinacy if he confines himself to his own line of thought; of incompetency, if he goes beyond it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 75","","It is very seldom that we satisfy ourselves; all the more consoling is it to have satisfied others."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 76","","We look back upon our life only as on a thing of broken pieces, because our misses and failures are always the first to strike us, and outweigh in our imagination what we have done, and attained."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Page 76","","It is always our eyes alone, our way of looking at things. Nature alone knows what she means now, and what she had meant in the past."
